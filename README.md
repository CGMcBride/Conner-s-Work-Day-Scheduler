# Conner-s-Work-Day-Scheduler

This assignment is designed to show my work day scheduler, I am using Jquery instead of normal JavaScript. You will notice that what would normaly take 5-6 lines of code can be done in 2-3 lines. Also when you open the actual browser based on the time in the block things will be color coded. The color red means that the time slot is taken based on the information in the text box, it will also be red to show the actual time when the meeting, event, workout is taken place in our current time. When the time block has not passed it will show as green to show its availble and when it is greyed out it is no longer available. You will be able to store your information and on page refreash it will still be there! This is to demonstrate the usage of local storage.
